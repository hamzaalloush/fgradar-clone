FGRADAR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=================================


REQUIREMENTS
------------

To build FGRadar you will need the following dependencies:

 - GTKmm 3.4 or later (and all its dependencies).
 - Boost 1.50.0 or later (thread and system components).

(These are not dependencies but are required to build the program).
 - CMake 2.8 or later (as the build system).
 - A compiler or IDE which has one. For example GCC for Linux or Visual Basic
   as an IDE for Windows.


LINUX / MAC or any other Unix-like system
-----------------------------------------

 - 0th: Check you have all the dependencies!

 - 1st: Create a folder called 'build' in the root directory of the program,
        either by typing 'mkdir build' via command-line inside the program root
        directory or in any file manager of your choice.

 - 2nd: Go inside the newly created folder and run the command 'cmake ..'.
        The '..' indicates the location of FGRadar's root directory.

 - 3rd: If everything runs OK, it means you have all the dependencies, now run
        the command 'make' to build the sources.

 - 4th: Once built, optionally run the 'make install' command to install
        sources globally in your system.


WINDOWS
-------

(Currently FGRadar doesn't fully support Windows systems, but it sure will do
in future updates).
