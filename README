FGRadar aims to create a stand-alone ATC client for the free and open-source
FlightGear flight simulator. The reason for this are several ATC aircrafts,
not really professional or accurate as a real ATC radar.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------

See the INSTALL file to see compiling instructions.

ABOUT THE GUI TOOLKIT
---------------------

FGRadar is implemented using GTKmm 3.4. Latest versions of GTKmm, such as 3.4,
are not available for other platform, only Linux.

You may be asking why I used GTKmm when there are, as most people say,
"awesome GUI toolkits out there". So, at first I used GTKmm, but then I
thought about people complaining about its not-cross-platform features. So
I changed to wxWidgets. After doing some work with it, I didn't like it for
several reasons, so I changed back to GTKmm.

Since this is an open-source project, everyone can contribute to it! I don't
feel comfortable working with QT or wxWidgets, nor with low-level GUIs such
as Xorg in Linux or the native Windows GUIs. If someone does, feel free to
write your own GUI! I am trying to make as flexible as I can, so it is easy
to add another GUI option without even disturbing other modules.
