For FGRadar:
- port build system to cmake (DONE)
- make sure that everything works for *nix/Win
- make the unix module really optional
- if necessary: port the I/O functions so that import() in driver.nas is supported on Windows, too
- make sure that the source tree can be easily built standalone AND embedded into other source trees like fgradar
- merge in more useful stuff from the original AlgoScore repository at: http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/algoscore/trunk/ 
- update the gtk bindings for gtk 3.0 (once gtk 3.x has become truly multi-platform!)


Misc:
- update SWIG
- fork/exec/system/open
- standalone
- unit tests (regression testing)
- git submodule: simgear
- add libcwd support
- add google perf tools support


standalone purposes:
- gui scripting (frontends): TerraGear GUI etc
