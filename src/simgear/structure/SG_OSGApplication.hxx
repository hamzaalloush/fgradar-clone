/*
	The Canvas subsystem will need something:

	- to attach its cameras to (osg::Group).
	
	- also, there has to be a property tree which will be used to control the canvas and 
	also by the canvas itself to parse informations back.
	
	- For user interaction, and displaying windows there will be needed an osgViewer and 
	a GUI camera (camera with orthogonal projection whose output goes to the application window/screen.
